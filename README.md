Hello,

This is my portfolio website project that I used to challenge myself to learn Reactjs, Next.js and Tailwind.css. I used components from the Shadcn UI to make a simple aesthetic portfolio website to show case
my skills as well as my projects. This website will be updated with future projects as well as additional features later down the line. I chose to host it on vercel as it was a convenient option from
the Next.js framework, it was free and my portfolio website is static content which will not require much resources.
